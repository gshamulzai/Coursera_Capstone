 Introduction/Business Problem 
 
 The business problem I will be examining will be data concerning opening a resturant within the surrounding boroughs of NYC.
 I will analyze the type of resturant, earnings report, social media data (Foursquare and Yelp), locations and any trends to 
 identify the type of resturant and the food and beverage program of said resturant. This is intended for prospective resturanteurs 
 to determine the type of resturant and which location would be the best to open the resturant.
