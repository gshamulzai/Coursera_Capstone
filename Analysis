After reviewing the data and the results of the k-means, I have come to the conclusion, that more data is needed. While there is a 56% the
new resturant would perform well in terms of check-ins and reviews, we need to wait until the goverment is re-opened to obtain the IRS or DOC 
databases on monies earned and paid. It would result in ultimely two types of reports, a statiscal inference and k-means to confidently identify 
criteria needed to identify these resturants.
