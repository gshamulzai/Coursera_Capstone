•	Introduction where you discuss the business problem and who would be interested in this project.
Introduction/Business Problem 
	 
	The business problem I will be examining will be data concerning opening a restaurant within the surrounding boroughs of NYC.
	 I will analyze the type of restaurant, number of check-ins in a day, number of reviews and location. I will then recommend a type of restaurant and the food it should serve. 
	 The data will identify the type of restaurant and the food and beverage program of said restaurant. This data would be useful and valuable to experienced and first time restaurateurs. 

•	Data where you describe the data that will be used to solve the problem and the source of the data.
The data which was primarily used was three datasets (csv) files from Yelp’s database. It will provide the details for the restaurant, location, popularity and reviews of their food.  
•	Methodology section which represents the main component of the report where you discuss and describe any exploratory data analysis that you did, any inferential statistical testing that you performed, and what machine learnings were used and why.
I loaded all three csv files and explored the datasets. Mo inferential statistics were performed due to the nature of the data being evaluated. I used k-means cluster analysis. It would run tests and determine the k amount needed to accurately predict which type of restaurant or eatery to open based on customer reviews, and number of check-ins with the location. 
•	Results section where you discuss the results.
 

•	This illustrates we need k means to equal 4 to obtain the elbow point. 56% prediction rate is too much of a hit and miss for restaurants. These types of the businesses are to volatile to remotely be confident in a choice. 

•	Discussion section where you discuss any observations you noted and any recommendations you can make based on the results. 
For NYC, a lot of restaurants were located in Brooklyn or Manhattan, which are the two most populous areas of NYC. 
•	Conclusion section where you conclude the report.
I conclude we perform for data mining to capture data from the IRS, Small Business Association, to ascertain what kinds of eateries were requesting loans and any revenue differences between the differed food types.
